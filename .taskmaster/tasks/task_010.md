**Title:** Comprehensive Error Handling, Logging, and Documentation

**Status:** pending

**Dependencies:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ⧖, 6, 7, 8, 9

**Priority:** medium

**Description:** Implement robust error handling, logging, and provide complete setup and admin documentation.

**Details:**

Use Python logging with INFO/ERROR levels, rotating file handler, and stdout. Log timestamp, level, module, message. Handle all error scenarios (Discord/Spotify API, database, playlist creation) with retries and admin notifications. Document setup (README), .env.example, database schema, deployment guide, admin workflow, and troubleshooting. Ensure code is well-commented and uses async/await throughout.

**Test Strategy:**

Simulate all error scenarios and verify logging and notifications. Review documentation for completeness and clarity. Check code comments and async usage.
