## Why JamBot?

JamBot was built by musicians, for musicians. No more manually searching for each song after a jam session.

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Automatic Detection" icon="magnifier">
    JamBot automatically detects when a jam leader posts a setlist in Discord and starts the approval workflow.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Smart Song Matching" icon="star">
    Uses your song history to pre-approve familiar tracks, and searches Spotify for new ones with multiple options.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Approval Workflow" icon="approve-check">
    Approvers receive DM notifications to review and approve song selections before creating the playlist.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Per-Server Config" icon="setting">
    Each Discord server has its own configuration, Spotify credentials, and song database.

## How It Works

1. **Jam Leader Posts Setlist** - A designated jam leader posts the setlist in Discord
2. **JamBot Detects & Searches** - JamBot parses the songs and searches Spotify
3. **Approvers Review** - Designated approvers receive DMs to review matches
4. **Playlist Created** - Once approved, the Spotify playlist is created and shared
