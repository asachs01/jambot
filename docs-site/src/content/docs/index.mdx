JamBot is a Discord bot that converts your jam session setlists into Spotify playlists automatically.

**Built by musicians, for musicians** — no more manually searching for each song after a jam session.

## Features

- **Automatic Detection** — JamBot detects when a jam leader posts a setlist in Discord and starts the approval workflow
- **Smart Song Matching** — Uses your song history to pre-approve familiar tracks, and searches Spotify for new ones with multiple options
- **Approval Workflow** — Approvers receive DM notifications to review and approve song selections before creating the playlist
- **Per-Server Config** — Each Discord server has its own configuration, Spotify credentials, and song database

## How It Works

1. **Jam Leader Posts Setlist** - A designated jam leader posts the setlist in Discord
2. **JamBot Detects & Searches** - JamBot parses the songs and searches Spotify
3. **Approvers Review** - Designated approvers receive DMs to review matches
4. **Playlist Created** - Once approved, the Spotify playlist is created and shared
