As a designated approver, you'll receive Direct Messages from JamBot to review and approve song selections before playlists are created.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Jam leader posts setlist** → JamBot detects and parses
2. **JamBot searches Spotify** → Finds song matches
3. **Approvers receive DMs** → Review and select songs
4. **Final approval** → Playlist created and posted

## Song Match Types

```

```

**Action**: React with ✅ or provide a different Spotify link

### Single Match (✅)

When JamBot finds exactly one match:

```
2. Blue Moon of Kentucky
✅ 1 match found - React to approve

🎵 3 matches found - React to select

```

**Action**: Search Spotify manually and reply with the track link

## Providing Manual Links

Reply to the DM with a Spotify track link:

```

JamBot will validate the link and confirm the selection.

## Final Approval

```
✅ Review complete! React with ✅ to create the playlist or ❌ to cancel.
```

1. Create playlist named "Bluegrass Jam [DATE]"
2. Add all approved tracks in setlist order
3. Post the playlist link to Discord
4. Store song versions for future jams
5. Send you a confirmation DM

## Manual Song Management

### Override a Song

```

### Find a Spotify Track Link

1. Open Spotify
2. Find the song
3. Click ••• → Share → Copy Song Link

## Best Practices

### Song Selection

2. **Quality**: Choose official releases over covers when available
3. **Availability**: Ensure tracks are available in your region

### Efficiency Tips

- Enable Discord notifications for JamBot DMs
- Keep Spotify open to preview tracks quickly
- Most songs will use stored versions after the first jam

## Troubleshooting

### Not Receiving DMs

- Verify your User ID is in the bot's configuration
- Check Discord privacy settings: Allow DMs from server members
- Ensure you share a server with JamBot

### Reactions Not Working

- Wait a moment after the message appears
- Remove and re-add your reaction

### Playlist Not Created

- Check your DM for error messages
- Verify Spotify credentials are valid
- Check bot logs for API errors
